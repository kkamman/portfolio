# Portfolio

This website :)

A website to showcase my hobby projects. I wanted it to be simple, fast and responsive.

This website uses:
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as a static site generator.
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) for animations.

<img src="/portfolio_light.png" alt="Portfolio website homepage" className="hidden dark:block" />

For styling the website I decided to use a css utility framework to keep the style consistent and to get it looking relatively good quite quickly, both on mobile and desktop.
I chose Tailwind CSS because I messed around with it before, and I wanted to try to use it in a project.

To generate a static website I used Next.js, because I wanted to try out React after primarily using Angular.

I wanted to add some simple animations to the homepage to learn more about them, so I decided to use Three.js to display some graphics and GSAP to animate them.
